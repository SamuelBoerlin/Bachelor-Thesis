\chapter{Implementation}

\section{Cineast}

\subsection{Cineast core changes}
UV + texture support in meshes and OBJ loader

\subsection{ClusterD2+Color feature extraction}
What, why (color support), explain assumptions made that were not covered by the paper

\subsection{Comparing features for similarity}
L2 distance, Jensen-Shannon divergence, $\chi^2$ distance

\subsection{RESTful API}
OpenAPI, swagger codegen

\section{Voxels}

\subsection{Voxel storage}
Chunks, hermite data quantization

\subsection{CMS}
Main algorithm on regular grid

\subsubsection{Multi-material extension for CMS}
Algorithm

\subsubsection{Lookup table based implementation}
Lookup table generator, lookup table based algorithm, limitations (time, multi-material support)

\subsection{CSG operations on hermite data}
How union and difference operations work on hermite data, algorithm

\subsection{Rendering}
Vertex colors encode material (RGB, A=texture id), texture array, triplanar texturing shader

\subsection{Voxelizer}
Purpose, explain method used for voxelization (assigning triangles to bins, patching holes, etc.), use of job system

\subsection{SDFs}
Implementation, arbitrary linear transformations by using the inverse to transform space instead of SDF

\section{VR Sculpting}

\subsection{Sculpting features}
General overview of capabilities and functionality, UIs, SteamVR Plugin, etc.

\subsection{Brush properties menu}
Functionalities, color selection (why HSV: you can see most colors at once, as opposed to RGB sliders)

\subsection{Custom brush editing menu}
Explain custom brush tool, why it exists, etc.
