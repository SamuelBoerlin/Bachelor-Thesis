\section{Virtual Reality Sculpting}

While virtual reality sculpting has not yet attracted the attention of the scientific research community, it has gained a lot of popularity in the games industry in recent years.
Medium\footnote{\url{https://www.oculus.com/medium}} offers a vast and mature toolbox to enable users to sculpt professional grade character models using the Oculus VR hardware.
Tilt Brush\footnote{\url{https://www.tiltbrush.com/}} takes a more painterly approach and mostly uses flat brush strokes to create scenes with a stylized hand drawn look. However, it also has some brush strokes that are 3D or can be animated. Quill\footnote{\url{https://quill.fb.com/}} uses a similar style and also offers extensive tools to let the user animate scenes smoothly. SculptVR\footnote{\url{http://www.sculptrvr.com/}} takes a voxel based approach similarly to the methods discussed in this thesis, but with more sophistication.
