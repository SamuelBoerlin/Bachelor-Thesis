\chapter{Concepts and Architecture}

\section{General overview}
How all components are connected to each other (cineast, feature module, cottontail, rest api, polygonizer, voxel storage, vr interaction controller, etc.)

\section{Cineast}
What is cineast, how does it work (feature modules, cottontail etc.)...

\subsection{Extraction Modules}
What, how

\subsection{Queries}
What, how, KNN, etc.

\section{Voxels}
What are voxels, purpose, hermite data, etc.

\section{Isosurface Polygonization}
Method for converting voxels into meshes, some common algorithms as examples

\section{CSG}

\section{Voxelization}

\section{Signed Distance Functions}
What are they, why are they relevant for this work

\section{Virtual Reality}
What is VR, use cases

\subsection{UI design}
Windows vs. using 3D space

\subsection{Sculpting interactions}
One hand to grab, other to sculpt, rotating brush with trackpad, etc.

\section{Unity}
What, why
