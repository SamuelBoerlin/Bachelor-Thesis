\section{Future work}
Performance, LODs/Octrees (SVO)/memory use (e.g. run length encoding), meshes as brushes (using voxelizer), saving/loading sculptures \& custom brushes, multiple sculptures at once, splitting sculptures.\\
More brush features, e.g. selecting a polygon and filling it with material. Line guide could automatically fill between start/end.\\
Custom brush editor could use mean position of primitives as brush center.\\
Add way to run exact more like this query without voxelization.
