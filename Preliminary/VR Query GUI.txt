Usability:
- How big should buttons be? Needs hands-on experimentation.

Visuals:
- Thumbnails could be retrieved directly from Cineast or be rendered
  into a texture on client side.
- Instead of thumbnails it could render a spinning 360Â° preview

Interaction:
- All Models/Objects can be grabbed in the GUI which will spawn them in
  the world/user's hand.
- Held object can be "put" into the top left query slot to search for similar
  objects in cineast's database.
- Similar to Vitrivr-NG's Query-by-Sketch, the user can grab a result from the GUI,
  modify it using the program's CSG operations, and then use the modified object
  for the new query.
